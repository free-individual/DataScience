# DataScience
A repository to track my journey as a Data Scientist. This repository will help me track and showcase at the same time my curious nature when it comes to working with data.

### Projects

Below is a list of projects contained in this repository.

### 1. [Iris Flower Classification](./Iris%20Classification/)

* **Description:** A complete data science project that starts with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the Iris dataset and concludes with building a Logistic Regression model to classify the flower species.
* **Technologies:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.

### 2. [California Housing Price Prediction](./California%20Housing%20Price%20Prediction/)

* **Description:** A comprehensive regression project to predict median house values in California. The project includes a thorough EDA, preprocessing steps like outlier removal and log transformation, and a comparison between a baseline `LinearRegression` model and a high-performing `RandomForestRegressor` model.
* **Technologies:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
