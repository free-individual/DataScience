# Exploratory Data Analysis of Iris Dataset.
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.13.3-blue)

## Description

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the classic Iris flower dataset. The goal is to explore the relationships between the features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and classify the different species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica).

## Key Findings

This analysis revealed that Setosa species is linearly seperable from the other two based on petal measurements. Versicolor and Virginica have some overlap but are still largely distinguishable.
